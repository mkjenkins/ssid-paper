\subsection*{Abstract}
Some Wi-Fi network clients transmit a list of networks they've
previously connected to when scanning for networks to join, and many
users are not aware that this data is broadcasted and can be easily
monitored. We hope to make users aware that this data can reveal
information about locations they spend time and their social
connections. We captured Wi-Fi probe requests from a sample of
wireless clients and analyzed the social network implied in the data
for privacy risks. We found that Apple laptops revealed the most,
while most mobile devices and computers running Linux no longer share
private data in probe requests. The data suggests that while some
computers no longer reveal previous network associations, large scale
data from the remaining clients could present a significant privacy
risk. Even at small scale the list of network associations is a
possible tool for Wi-Fi client fingerprinting. Our work concurs with
other recent studies showing that network associations can be used to
fingerprint Wi-Fi clients or link users to certain political organizations or other groups based on the names of the networks. To encourage
users to be more security conscious we provided participants with a
personalized interactive social network graph showing how their
network associations relate them to other participants. We include
results from a survey conducted to understand participants' reactions
to this data.

\section{Introduction}
Laptops broadcast the list of Wi-Fi networks (SSID's) that a user has ever connected to. The list of SSID's is broadcasted when your laptop is attempting to connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot (access point). With the proliferation of mobile devices and laptops Wi-Fi access points have become ubiquitous. Passive Wi-Fi tracking has started to gain popularity amongst retailers, advertisers, and data analytics companies to glean useful information about people. Anyone can access this information if they are nearby and have a computer or other Wi-Fi device. A quick google search for passive Wi-Fi tracking reveals tutorial after tutorial on how to conduct passive Wi-Fi tracking. It is a trivial undertaking to extract this data while it's being broadcast. 

Previously cell phones broadcast this data however recently they have stopped. A large majority of users are unaware that this metadata is being publicly broadcast and can be easily collected. The fact that this data is being broadcast raises privacy and security concerns. Your SSID list is a form of location history. From your SSID list it could be inferred what your favorite coffees shop is, what conferences you attend, your social and political affiliations and where you work among other things. It also raises some security concerns. An attacker who captures this information could conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, an evil twin attack or Auto Association Karma Attack to name a few. 

In contrast to recent work in this area this paper focuses on the broadcast of SSID's from laptops attempting to connect to a Wi-Fi access point. We will demonstrate how this data can be collected and used to imply social networks. We will explore the privacy and security implications of this publicly broadcast metadata. We do so by collecting data from Wi-Fi access points and rendering social network graphs and examining the connections. In section 2 we discuss Wi-Fi network scanning. In section 3 we mention related work in this area. From section 4 onwards we discuss our study methods, results, and conclude.



\section{Background}
Every wireless enabled device has to go through a discovery process to connect to a Wi-Fi access point. Clients need to know what wireless networks are available both to offer them as choices to users and to automatically reconnect to access points they've been previously associated with.

Most simplistically, a client can passively receive beacon frames broadcast by access points. Beacon frames are sent about 10 times per second and broadcast information about the network like its name (or SSID) \cite{cisco}. Access points can be configured in a hidden mode in which they don't send beacon frames, so passive scanning can't connect to hidden networks.

Another method of scanning is broadcast probing. Probe requests are a type of management frame sent by the client that include it's MAC address and request that access points in range announce themselves. Access points respond to probe requests with probe responses containing similar information to beacon frames. Like passive scanning, broadcast probing can't find hidden networks. However, it may enable faster association because the client initiates the interchange and doesn't need to wait for the access point to send a beacon.

Finally, a client can use directed probing. Just as with broadcast probing the client sends probe request management frames. With directed probing, however, the probe request frames each indicate a wireless network the client is interested in connecting to. Access points in hidden mode do respond to these directed probes. Clients usually list networks that have been manually configured or to which they've been previously connected when performing directed probing.

Different laptops use different probe request methods. Cell phones use a mixture of broadcast probes and passive scanning. To gather this data is trivial with access to a computer or Wi-Fi device. The laptop or Wi-Fi device can be put into monitor to pickup nearby traffic. In doing so the device in monitor mode is not broadcasting its presence, making it hard to detect if a nearby user is collecting your metadata.

\section{Related Work}
There is a fairly large body of work investigating the utility of metadata that is broadcast when connecting to Wi-Fi access points. The majority of the work was targeted at cell phones and not laptops. Recently cell phones have stopped broadcasting the SSID list when probing for Wi-Fi connections.

Cheng et al \cite{cheng} sought to discover user relationships from observing the similarity of SSID lists between users, they took into account physical proximity and spatio-temporal behavior. They looked at the similarities of SSID lists being broadcast from cell phones before cell phones disabled this feature. They found that spatio-temporal data had more social connections. They believed their work could be applied to research in social ties and the deployment of wireless networks.

Barbera et al \cite{barbera} used social network analysis on datasets of Wi-Fi probes from cell phones in public areas. They found that data matched typical properties of social networks. They also mentioned what devices broadcast the SSID list when probing for a connection.

Desmond et al \cite{desmond} discussed an alternative approach to fingerprinting that defeats MAC address randomization and the absence of an SSID list by timing the intervals between Wi-Fi probes, but requires hours of continuous data to perform adequately. Their results indicated that this technique is accurate in differentiating between unique devices. Their approach is different from other technique because it is passive and non-invasive.

Cunche et al \cite{cunche}  present a mechanism to detect links between people by fingerprinting devices by exploiting the fact the SSID lists are broadcast in plain text when probing for WI-FI connections. They take a very quantitative approach and are able to gather a large data set. This work demonstrates a privacy breach allowed by the 802.11 probe requests and raises awareness that initiative should be taken to increase privacy in terms of access point discovery. 

Greenstein et al \cite{greenstein} makes the argument that it is in the best interest of not only users, but also manufacturers, to address the privacy threats that wireless networks pose. The authors considered an 802.11 case study and analyzed 802.11 traces. They used this information to show that, over time, devices can be identified and tracked through its SSID lists, its persistent link-layer address, and other characteristics. The authors of this work provide suggestions for ways to improve privacy through design considerations.

\section{Privacy Considerations}
To conduct this study we had to take into consideration the security and privacy of our participants so as to minimize harm but still collect meaningful data. The intent of our project is to reveal the potential privacy implications of the type of data we collected, so we had to address the reasonable privacy concerns of our participants.

\subsection{Location Data}
While we didn't directly collect location history, the names of wireless networks often identify a location. The name itself might describe the location, like the name of a business or airport. It might also be recorded in a database of wireless networks. Companies like Apple and Google use such databases to geolocate devices based on surrounding wireless networks but there are also publicly available databases assembled by hobbyists. All sorts of networks including homes, workplaces, and social locations like coffee shops are included in these databases. One such publicly available database is wiggle.net. Figure~\ref{wiggle} shows the location associated with one of the networks that appeared in our study.

\end{figure*}




\subsection{De-identification}
Other participants have information to de-identify

De-identification risks in time-series data

While a lot of research has been done on the topic of de-identification an 
argument has been made that available data and data from previously de-identified data sets can be used to 
re-identify individuals. \cite{narayanan} As it relates to our study, although we annoymized nodes
when sending personal graphs to participants, if could be possible to identify someone through a common 
network if you are aware that they connected to a particular network, you connected to the same network, 
and no other participants connected to the same network. Through this one could see which other networks
this now identified person has connected to. Adminittedly, with a larger data set re-identification 
would be more challenging.

\subsection{Other Risks}
We took precautionary measures to protect the anonymity of our users and the data we collected from them. All participants in the study were required to opt in to the study by signing an informed consent. The informed consent notified the participants what data we would be collecting, how we would use it, and what our data retention policies were. Any data we collected we encrypted the data in transit and at rest. 

Personalized social network graphs created another privacy risk for our study. We did not want any other participants to be able to identify other nodes on the graph. We decided that only showing the networks that two or more participants had connected to would reduce this risk. We also did not look at the data when generating the graphs.



\section{Data Collection}
Because of the privacy concerns discussed above, we decided to only collect SSID lists from those who actively chose to participate in to the study. We also decided against using time series data.

In the original design of our study, we had planned to collect data from a public location in a university building for up to a week. We needed a device to capture packets that was inexpensive and could be easily concealed to guard against theft. We also wanted to ensure that the device wouldn't hold previously captured data so that nothing about participants could be revealed in the event of theft. Our tool of choice was the Wi-Fi Pineapple, a small dual radio wireless access point designed for penetration testing. The second radio lets the Pineapple connect to a normal Wi-Fi network to communicate with our server to receive commands and return the captured data. We configured the Pineapple to establish an ssh connection and reverse port forward on a server on Amazon Web Services. Then the server controlled the Pineapple on an ssh connection through the reverse tunnel. Captured packets were immediately forwarded through the SSH connection to the server so that no participant data was persistently stored on the Pineapple.

We captured and filtered packets on the Pineapple with the scapy python library to minimize the amount of data that we had to backhaul to the server. As discussed in section~\ref{bpf}, we would have done better to filter packets in the kernel with linux socket filtering to improve performance. On the server we stored the collected SSID lists in sqlcipher, an AES-256 encrypted version of sqlite. All of our access to the collected data was mediated by Python scripts that limited the data that we could see according to the privacy rules we defined in our informed consent document, and the participant reports were similarly assembled and sent programmatically to limit our exposure to private participant data.

\section{Data Evaluation}
We were less successful in capturing data than we anticipated. Of our 28 participants (including the authors), 18 only yielded zero or one network name. Figure~\ref{histogram} shows the full distribution of network counts. Following data collection, we performed some further experiments to explain these disappointing results.

\subsection{Capture Reliability}
The three individuals yielding the most network names were the authors. We hypothesize that more complete network lists were collected from our devices because they were present near the monitoring device for an extended period of time, so there were multiple opportunities to capture the data. As a test we measured the number of network names cumulatively collected by packet capture while a MacBook scanned for wireless networks a number of times. We found that a capture of only a single scan yielded on average only 31\% of the network list (with 28 networks total) and that we'd need to capture four or five scans to get a mostly-complete list. Figure~\ref{scans} shows the complete results of this experiment. An attacker able to monitor traffic over a long period of time likely wouldn't find this to be a problem, but it might thwart reliable fingerprinting of clients an access point only sees once. However, we suspect that our failure to capture the SSID list reliably was not because they were not transmitted, but because our receiver was overwhelmed and unable to keep up with filtering.

\subsection{Linux Socket Filtering}
\label{bpf}
During packet capture with scapy we found that the Wi-Fi Pineapple occasionally froze, requiring a restart, and at other times took several seconds to register new packets. We suspect that our packet filtering code in python wasn't able to keep up with the volume of captured packets. The Pineapple only has a 400 MHz processor, and each packet received must be communicated from kernel-space to user-space by a system call before it is filtered in python. Sometime after the data collection phase of our project we learned about linux socket filtering, a way to filter packets in kernel-space before they are returned to a packet monitoring application. Filters from tools like tcpdump typically use this method. The filtering rules available through tcpdump are sufficient to express the filter we'd written in scapy. Testing with tcpdump filtering shows that it reliably collects at least 16 of 28 networks from a single scan. It isn't clear why only 16 of the network names appear to be transmitted during a scan. Perhaps the laptop successfully established a connection before needing to complete the scan; more seem to be transmitted when initially enabling wireless in a location where none of the remembered wireless networks are available. Overall we suspect that if we'd used kernel level filtering during the data collection phase of our study we would have collected more network names from some of our participants.

\subsection{Operating System Behavior}
Another factor limiting the volume of data we captured was encouraging --- it appears that Linux and Windows clients don't generally perform directed probes, opting instead for broadcast probes unless a network was specially configured. During data collection we noted that captures from devices running Linux usually only included a single SSID plus a broadcast probe. The final social network graph discussed in section~\ref{social} shows many devices only having connected to UConnect, the campus wireless network. We hypothesize that Linux devices transmit directed probes only for the network they're currently connected to or were most recently connected to. Other networks are discovered by broadcast probes. Documentation for wpa\_supplicant on linux suggests that users could configure individual networks for which directed probes should be used, like hidden networks, but that otherwise it would use broadcast probes. We haven't found documentation for the behavior on Windows but we suspect that it similarly only uses directed probes for manually configured networks that may be hidden. Of the 5 devices in our study that yielded 3 or more network names, all were Apple devices. At least one of those devices was running the latest release of OS X, Yosemite.

These results suggest that vendors other than Apple have recognized the security and privacy implications of directed probes and modified their devices to instead use broadcast probes. Our testing suggests that Apple has done the same for its mobile devices, but not for OS X. Given that other platforms have demonstrated that broadcast probing works effectively we argue that Apple should change the behavior of OS X to better preserve privacy.

\section{Social Network Analysis}

SSID lists and MAC addresses can be used to infer social networks and ties\cite{cheng}. Although we didn't gather enough data to infer large social networks we gathered enough to construct a graph of the participants and the SSID's the participants had in common. The filtered metadata was used to create personalized social network graphs for each participant. The graphs were rendered using Javascripts D3 library. The graphs were rendered and sent out to participants with an automated script so that their complete SSID lists and graphs were never looked at. 

Figure 3 is an example social network graph. The green nodes denote the anonmyized participants, the purple node indicates the participant, and the orange nodes denote the SSID's shared among participants. Along with the graph the list of SSID's that was broadcast by the participants laptop was included. They are not pictured here to protect this individuals privacy. Wi-Fi access points were only included if more than two users had connected to them. We promised not to include the home network names and only one home network name had at least two participants that had connected to it. The network happened to be one of the authors home networks so we received authorization to include it in the network graph. 

The nodes on our graph are what we anticipated. A mixture of University access points, coffee shops, and airports. From this graph we could infer that some students of the University of Utah frequent Coffee Break and have traveled outside of Salt Lake by airplane. While the information we gathered is rather benign, larger data collection and social network analysis is viable and could reveal much more meaningful information. 

\section{Implications}

There are far-reaching implications of the plain text SSID list data. There are privacy and security risks. We focus on a locational narrative and client fingerprinting.

\subsection{Location Narrative}
 One such implication is the possibility of a creating a location narrative based on  the information from this list. 
wigle.net is a tool that could assist in creating this narrative. Wigle.net is a 
submission based catalog of wireless networks. If a network you have connected to has been 
submitted to such a database and your SSID connection list is revealed then your location 
information can be obtained as well. We were able to see that three out of the four of our
most connected to networks were available on this database; searching for "SALTLAKECOFFEEBREAK", 
"UCONNECT", and "slcairport.wifi" all returned hits on the map. 
While the information that was collected in our study was seemingly innocuous, especially 
due to our filtering strategies, the same strategies can be used maliciously. 
Network names coupled with the locations of the network can easily be used to identify 
the whereabouts of an individual. 


\subsection{Client Fingerprinting}

Fingerprinting is meant to identify unique users. We wanted to look at fingerprinting participants based upon the participants SSID lists. We thought that based upon the different networks participants have connected to the lists would be different enough that we could uniquely identify participants. While the lists in our study were unique from one another we did not gather near enough data to conclusively say it is possible to fingerprint solely based upon your SSID list. Not only was our sample size not large enough different operating systems varied in the amount of information they was leaked. Complete SSID lists were not always captured making this more challenging to get an accurate list. We leave this for future work.

Related works in this area have successfully fingerprinted devices and inferred social networks from the similarities of these fingerprints. One such work noted that it was possible to infer relationships from the SSID list similarities and grouped participants with similar SSID lists into groups to infer social ties \cite{cunche}. Two other works successfully fingerprinted using the timing of the probe request frames \cite{desmond} and the waveform \cite{ureten}. These works focus more on security than privacy.


\section{Participant Survey}


To gauge our participants reactions we asked our participants to complete a survey after viewing their personalized social network graph. The survey included three questions. The first being did you know prior to our project that your SSID list is broadcast when you probe to connect to a Wi-Fi network? The second was what are you reactions to your personalized study results? The third question was not mandatory. It was what are you reactions to this study in general?

 We did not receive responses from the majority of our participants. Every participant that did respond answered no they did not know this data was being broadcast. The last two questions were to gauge the sentiment of our participants. The answers ranged from being shocked to that it didn't matter to them that their data was broadcast but they could see the utility of the metadata for advertisers. In general our participants did now know that this data was broadcasted and seemed unconcerned by it.


\section{Future Work}
While it appears that directed probing is on the decline, Wi-Fi networks still present other security and privacy concerns. Future work is needed to measure these risks and develop improved wireless protocols that are more secure and provide improved guarantees of privacy. As vendors move away from directed probing they usually move to broadcast probes. Broadcast probes don't reveal a list of remembered networks, but they do reveal the MAC address of the client. MAC addresses from probes are increasingly used to track people through physical spaces. IOS 8 is reported use a randomized MAC address for probes, but we aren't aware of a study examining the prevalence of MAC address randomization in non-Apple devices. Even given MAC randomization in probes, devices generally reveal their true MAC address when associated with a wireless network. It should be possible to design a wireless protocol in which no unique identifier is transmitted in the clear. Devices would only share a unique identifier after establishing an encrypted connection with an access point. Such a protocol could limit device fingerprinting to much less accessible physical layer attacks measuring the characteristics of wireless radios.

\section{Conclusion}

We were able to see that although certain devices and operating systems have moved 
to safer probing strategies the public broadcasting of SSID lists is still a privacy concern.  
The data that we were able to collect showed that information from SSID lists can be used for 
location tracking as well as client fingerprinting. Our survey results showed that all of those 
surveyed were not aware of the broadcasting of this information. Due to our
data protection strategies there were not highly interesting patterns to be seen in our social network 
graphs but it is clear that malicious individuals could easily sniff the SSID list information and use 
it to their potential benefit. While certain devices and operating dystems have made strides in 
altering their probing strategies more still needs to be regarding probing strategies in order to 
minimize the broadcasting of potentially sensitive data.
